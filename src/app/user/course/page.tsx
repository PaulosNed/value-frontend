            At Value College Prep, we don’t just apply to colleges for you; we
            teach you how to apply to the best schools yourself. The reason we
            empower you to take control of your application is simple: no one
            will be as passionate about your future as you are. When you hand
            off your application to someone else, they often put in the bare
            minimum effort, which can lead to getting accepted into schools that
            are a poor fit, have higher visa refusal rates, low scholarships, or
            even worse—schools that aren’t accredited.

            {`Some students have faced serious issues like losing their passports,
            being blackmailed, or overcharged by consultancies. The most
            critical aspect, though, is that without demonstrating a deep
            understanding of the application process, your visa could be
            rejected. But if you're in control, you can avoid these risks and
            get into a school that’s truly right for you.`}

            country without concern for the quality of the university, other
            services might be a better fit. However, if you want to improve your
            skills, understand the school and location you're going to, meet
            alumni, and secure better scholarships, then this is the right
